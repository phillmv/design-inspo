body: "# Quick Investigation Into #Kitchen Design Principles\r\n\r\n>Getting the layout
  right is absolutely crucial and I always tell my clients that the layout comes first
  when designing. \r\n\r\nhttps://kitchinsider.com/best-kitchen-layouts/\r\n\r\n>Try
  to think of it like this: when you’re stood at the hob can you pivot and walk 1-3
  steps to get to the fridge, then pivot and walk 1-3 steps to the sink to fill your
  pan with water, then pivot and walk back to the hob?\r\n\r\n>Another approach I
  like to take when designing a kitchen layout is to create zones within the kitchen.
  These are sections of the kitchen dedicated to a particular task. I then make sure
  everything you need to complete that task is easily accessible. … Think about your
  most common daily tasks in the kitchen and create zones for them.\r\n\r\n>My general
  rule of thumb is that the distance between cabinets or cabinets and walls (the pinch
  points in your kitchen) should be no smaller than 1 metre. Much less, and it becomes
  tight and feels squashed.\r\n\r\n>A little more is great, but up to a point. Having
  a 3-metre gap between your cabinets can create too much wasted space. \r\n\r\n>Similarly,
  my general rule for seating at a breakfast bar is 60 cm per person. This allows
  enough elbow room to feel comfortable and not on top of one another, while not being
  so wide you can’t fit enough people at the bar.\r\n\r\n![image6.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image6.png)\r\n\r\nhttp://therenoprojects.com/kitchen-design-101/\r\n\r\n>Any
  walk through area in a kitchen should be no less than 36″ wide. In this example,
  I had to consider the door of the stove opening as well as someone standing to open
  it. 36″ should be allocated on either side of an island, peninsula or any walk through
  area.\r\n\r\nseating\r\n>Each person needs at least 24″ of space when sitting, with
  a 12″-14″ overhang for leg space. \r\n\r\n>One final tip is to remember the working
  triangle in your kitchen. This triangle ensures your fridge, stove and sink are
  at a comfortable distance away from each other to perform tasks.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cliqstudios.com/kitchen-design-principles/\r\n\r\nsymmetry,
  focal points\r\n\r\n![image.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://homedesigntutorials.com/2017/10/14/kitchen-design-principles/\r\n\r\n>The
  two main principles in kitchen design are the work sequence and the kitchen triangle.
  \r\n\r\nThe work sequence is the order of activities involved in preparing food.
  This means all the steps from walking in with the groceries, storing the produce,
  to prepping, cooking, eating, and to eventually cleaning it all away. We can break
  these down into six main steps, which are explained below;\r\n\r\n1. Store – unloading
  and unwrapping of food, storing in refrigerator/freezer/ larder/cupboards\r\n2.
  Wash – washing, peeling, chopping, sieving food, dishwashing\r\n3. Prepare – weighing,
  mixing cake and pastry making\r\n4. Cook – hob for boiling and frying, grill for
  grilling and browning, oven for baking and roasting,  microwave oven for defrosting,
  fast cooking and heating.\r\n5. Serve – dishing up food, keeping food hot, toasting
  bread, storing cutlery, crockery and condiments\r\n6. Eat – table laying and eating\r\n\r\n\r\n>The
  work triangle is the relationship between three of the main appliances used in the
  kitchen – the refrigerator, sink, and the cooker. As a rule of thumb, when we add
  the lengths together, the sum should not be less than 3.5 meters, and no more than
  6.5 meters.\r\n\r\nhttp://starcraftcustombuilders.com/kitchen.design.rules.htm\r\n\r\n![image2.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image2.png)\r\n\r\n![image3.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image3.png)\r\n\r\n![image4.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image4.png)\r\n\r\n![image5.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image5.png)"
