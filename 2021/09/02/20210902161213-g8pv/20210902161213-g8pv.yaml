  in a kitchen should be no less than 36″ wide. In this example, I had to consider
  the door of the stove opening as well as someone standing to open it. 36″ should
  be allocated on either side of an island, peninsula or any walk through area.\r\n\r\nseating\r\n>Each
  person needs at least 24″ of space when sitting, with a 12″-14″ overhang for leg
  space. \r\n\r\n>One final tip is to remember the working triangle in your kitchen.
  This triangle ensures your fridge, stove and sink are at a comfortable distance
  away from each other to perform tasks.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cliqstudios.com/kitchen-design-principles/\r\n\r\nsymmetry,

  two main principles in kitchen design are the work sequence and the kitchen triangle.
  \r\n\r\nThe work sequence is the order of activities involved in preparing food.
  This means all the steps from walking in with the groceries, storing the produce,
  to prepping, cooking, eating, and to eventually cleaning it all away. We can break
  these down into six main steps, which are explained below;\r\n\r\n1. Store – unloading
  and unwrapping of food, storing in refrigerator/freezer/ larder/cupboards\r\n2.
  Wash – washing, peeling, chopping, sieving food, dishwashing\r\n3. Prepare – weighing,
  mixing cake and pastry making\r\n4. Cook – hob for boiling and frying, grill for
  grilling and browning, oven for baking and roasting,  microwave oven for defrosting,
  fast cooking and heating.\r\n5. Serve – dishing up food, keeping food hot, toasting
  bread, storing cutlery, crockery and condiments\r\n6. Eat – table laying and eating\r\n\r\n\r\n>The
  work triangle is the relationship between three of the main appliances used in the
  kitchen – the refrigerator, sink, and the cooker. As a rule of thumb, when we add
  the lengths together, the sum should not be less than 3.5 meters, and no more than
  6.5 meters.\r\n\r\nhttp://starcraftcustombuilders.com/kitchen.design.rules.htm\r\n\r\n![image2.png](/phillmv/design-inspo/20210902161213-g8pv/files/image2.png)"
