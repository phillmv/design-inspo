  goals\r\n\r\n- buffer space between outdoors & home\r\n- storage place to absorb
  mess, jackets\r\n- ideally, keep the space _flexible_\r\n\r\n>the mudroom also needs
  to be designed with traffic flow in mind.  Are the doors going to swing and be out
  of the way? If someone is putting on their shoes, is there room for someone else
  to grab their jacket?\r\n\r\neasy to clean (tile flooring etc); storage, people
  can move around.\r\n\r\n- create a checklist of what you will need to store, and
  how those items can be stored."
