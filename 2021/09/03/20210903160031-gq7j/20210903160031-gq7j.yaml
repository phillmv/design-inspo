body: "# Quick Investigation into Mudroom Design Principles\r\n\r\n## goals\r\n\r\n-
  buffer space between outdoors & home\r\n- storage place to absorb mess, jackets\r\n-
  ideally, keep the space _flexible_\r\n\r\n>the mudroom also needs to be designed
  with traffic flow in mind.  Are the doors going to swing and be out of the way?
  If someone is putting on their shoes, is there room for someone else to grab their
  jacket?\r\n\r\neasy to clean (tile flooring etc); storage, people can move around.\r\n\r\n-
  create a checklist of what you will need to store, and how those items can be stored."
