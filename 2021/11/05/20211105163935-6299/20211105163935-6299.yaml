body: "# Kitchen Design Exploration\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n\r\n- Per [[20210902161213-g8pv]],
  explore the ~5 different kinds of layouts in our setting\r\n- Explore taking down
  the kitchen wall in layout\r\n  - basically, how do people think about interior
  walls? am i being ridiculous?\r\n- What about the bsmt entrance? can we incorporate
  it somehow?\r\n\r\nPretty mechanical: just try each kind of layout for size, then
  rinse and repeat without the interior walls."
