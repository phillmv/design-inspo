body: "# Kitchen Design Exploration 2022-01-22\r\n\r\nokay let's do this one layout
  at a time.\r\n\r\ni generated a clean version of our kitchen in photoshop.\r\n\r\n-
  let's assume we keep the entrance where it is for now.\r\n  - people come in thru
  mudroom\r\n  - they take off boots, put up jackets\r\n  - storage??\r\n  - bigger
  window somehow\r\n\r\nwalk northward thru the space it doesn't turn into a dead
  cubby hole of junk\r\ni'd been envisioning a low wall or bar but what if it's open?\r\n\r\nlike
  even on a design level what literally are my options for placing the kitchen? just
  mechanically even without thinking about it too much it.\r\n\r\nthere's single wall.\r\n\r\nokay
  sketched a version.\r\n\r\n"
